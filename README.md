# Implementing websocket protocol in JavaScript

Implementing protocol from scratch in JavaScript/Node.js to learn how does it work internally

- Clone the repo and get started: ```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sanketghosh/implementing-ws-js.git```
- Node version `v22.12.0` needed (at least) as I am using NodeJS TS `--experimental-strip-types`
